Cakery Class Assignment
============================================================

------------------------------------------------------------
Summary
------------------------------------------------------------

The cakery class assignment utility is an attempt to
perform fair division of a limited number of class
assignments between a number of students with non-uniform
preferences about the classes they would like to take. The
goal is to provide a class assignment that is proportional
among the students and if possible envy free.

The current algorithm being used to provide these gurantees
is Banach-Knaster's Trimming Algorithm.
