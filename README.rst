Summary
============================================================

This is a collection of school work that I have added
after the classes in question have finished. It is really
here as a resource for me to review and not neccessarily
here as library code. Feel free to borrow or take anything
that can help out:

------------------------------------------------------------
431
------------------------------------------------------------

This is the code for the compilers course. All of the code
is in Java using jflex, cup, and jasmine.

------------------------------------------------------------
511
------------------------------------------------------------

This is a artifical intelligence class from my masters work.
Most of the code is in python and follows a rough framework
for the class.

------------------------------------------------------------
514
------------------------------------------------------------

This is a data mining class from my masters work. Most of
the code has actually been moved to the https://github.com/bashwork/wdm/
repository (so others in my group could contribute). The
code is in java and scala.

There is also a final project in the https://github.com/bashwork/twatter/
repository that is also in java and scala with some shell scripting
to help.

------------------------------------------------------------
559
------------------------------------------------------------

This is a computer vision course from my masters work. Most
of the code is in python and deals with face detection, pca,
stereograms, adaboost, etc.

There is also another project I did in c# at:
http://code.google.com/p/image-segment/

------------------------------------------------------------
556
------------------------------------------------------------

This is the code for human computer interaction.
The https://github.com/bashwork/trip.me is the code for this
class, however, it was moved to
http://code.google.com/p/guide-me/ so others could work on the
project and reserve more space for data files.

------------------------------------------------------------
520
------------------------------------------------------------

This is the code for real time systems (most of the code is
soft real time in the academic sense).
The https://github.com/bashwork/shell-service is the code for this
class. There is also another repository for this project at
http://code.google.com/p/shel-platform/ so others could work on the
project and reserve more space for data files.

------------------------------------------------------------
544
------------------------------------------------------------

This is the code for the fair division game theory class. It
is basically a framework for defining resources and preferences
for those resources in a low level way. The remainder of the
code builds high level primitives out of these and then builds
high level algorithms for dividing resources.  The code is in
python.

------------------------------------------------------------
coursera-ml
------------------------------------------------------------

This is the code and notes for the coursera machine learning
class taught by Andrew Ng. The code is in octave

------------------------------------------------------------
coursera-scala
------------------------------------------------------------

This is the code and notes for the coursera functional
programming in Scala class taught by Martin Odersky. The
code is obviously in Scala.
