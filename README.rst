Summary
============================================================

This is a collection of school work that I have added
after the classes in question have finished. It is really
here as a resource for me to review and not neccessarily
here as library code. Feel free to borrow or take anything
that can help out:

This is a artifical intelligence class from my masters work.
Most of the code is in python and follows a rough framework
for the class.

514
------------------------------------------------------------

This is a data mining class from my masters work. Most of
the code has actually been moved to the wdm repository of
my account (so others in my group could contribute). The
code is in java and scala with some shell scripting to help.

------------------------------------------------------------
559
------------------------------------------------------------

This is a computer vision course from my masters work. Most
of the code is in python and deals with face detection, pca,
stereograms, adaboost, etc.

There is also another project I did in c# at:

coursera-ml
------------------------------------------------------------

This is the code and notes for the coursera machine learning
class taught by Andrew Ng. The code is in octave
