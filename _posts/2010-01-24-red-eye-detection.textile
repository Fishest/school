h2. Problem and Solution

In the language of your choice, create a program that reads in an image,
finds the eyes, and outputs the image with the eye location marked.

I chose to detect eyes by using red-eye detection and removal.
The solution was obtained by the following steps:

* read the image into Matlab
* run the image through three predetermined color thresholds (RGB)
  * these were created with inspection using impixel on the image
* combine the three color logic vectors into a single logic vector of pixel locations
* remove the original image's red component where the pixel is true in the logic vector

h2. Successful Image Conversion

h2. Less Than Successful Image Conversion

Since the following image does not contain red eyes (especially red eyes that are
in the same range as the previous image), we not only do not detect the subject's
eyes, but we accidently detect random parts of the tunic instead.
