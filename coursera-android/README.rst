Coursera Android Course
============================================================

These are my notes and assignment submissions for the android
course taught on coursera. Each folder represents a week in
the class. They are each structured as follows:

* `notes.rst` - the notes for the class
* `documentation` - the documentation for the assignments
* `projects` - the coding assignments for the week
