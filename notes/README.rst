Summary
============================================================

These are a collection of notes about various books and
papers that I have read. Sadly most of my previous notes
are in paper and I am a little too lazy at the moment to
transcribe them.

.. note::

   Sometimes the notes may be lazy as I was coding and
   I saved the code as the notes instead or added some
   notes as an after thought. YMMV.
