SMART Design Requirements
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The *SMART* system proposed writing design requirements such that they are:

* **Specific (Significant)**

  Requirements must be specific and not generic. It is too easy to make
  requirments that are so loose that it is nearly impossible to judge whether or
  not they have ben hit or not. For example, a statement like "It will show
  product details" is too vague. How will you know if you have met this
  requirement? Saying, "It will show product description as obtained from
  catalog data" is more specific.

* **Measurable (Meaningful)**

  Requirements need to be measurable. Can someone else tick a check-box to
  indicate this requirement has been met? For example, "improving customer
  experience" captures the intent, but how can it be measured? A better statement
  would be: "Improve user experience measured by using click metrics to verify
  that 60% of customers reach their desired destination within 5 clicks within
  10 seconds".

* **Achievable (Attainable)**

  Requirements need to be reasonable and achievable. Don't try to boil the ocean.
  "All users will move from using Perforce to Git within the next 3 weeks" is
  clearly unachievable if 50% of the internet is using Perforce.

* **Relevant (Realisable)**

  Requirements need to be clearly connected to the primary intent of a project.
  A requirement of "Provides a build system capable of building any software
  package for any device" is outside of the realm of a project that is building
  ARM-based firmware for a Camera. Rather the requirement is "Can build the
  packages required by the ARM-based camera through the build system" is more
  relevant to the project at hand, even if there is a need for the former.

* **Timely (Trackable / Traceable / Time Bounded)**

  We are developing software rapidly with multiple milestones. Does the
  requirement make sense for the intended milestone, or should it be deferred
  for a future milestone?

* **Single Responsibility Principle**

  A class should have only a single responsibility (i.e. only one potential
  change in the software's specification should be able to affect the
  specification of the class)

* **Open / Closed Principle**

  Software entities should be open for extension, but closed for modification.

* **Liskov Substitution Principle**

  Objects in a program should be replaceable with instances of their subtypes
  without altering the correctness of that program.‚Äù See also design by contract.

* **Interface Segregation Principle**

  Many client-specific interfaces are better than one general-purpose interface.

* **Dependency Inversion Principle**

  High-level modules should not depend on low-level modules. Both should depend
  on abstractions. Abstractions should not depend on details. Details should
  depend on abstractions.
