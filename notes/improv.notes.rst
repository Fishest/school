Improv Notes
================================================================================

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Class 1:
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

* What makes improv relevant as a form
  - Improv is the only theatre art form that can be truly current
  - Make your improv relevant and a reflection of your era
  - Can someone watch an old recording of your show and understand your context
  - Don't sacrifice social / historical style for some school's rules
* Let the audience tell the story, they are better than you
  - Don't get in your head when you are on stage
  - Accept a yes / no promise before the first 5 offers
  - Check out the blank slate show to see how good the audience is
  - The audience came to hear the story their way, so give it to them
  - Humor comes from gags or being relatable; go for the latter
* Gags destroy a scene, use them only to end scenes that have no ending
* Don't add new rules to the games, it changes their meanings
* Know why you doing improv
  - The Harold was made to protest the Vietnam war; what are you doing?
  - Apparently no one likes Chicago Improv or UCB
  - Apparently LA and NY are for selling out
* Take a risk and trust yourself and your abilities
  - You will either fail miserably or succeed amazingly instead of just being okay
  - The Harold is the ultimate improv risk (an hour of boredom), but that is what you signed up for
* If you get wiped from a scene or held longer than you wanted, work with it
  - If wiped, you will have more ideas; plenty more
  - When you don't know what will happen, great things can happen
  - Trust your impulses and just go it, even if you are not completely ready
  - Don't be afraid to end a scene quickly good or bad
* Invite risk and the unexpected
  - Don't have a priori setups to resolve ambiguity (walk in strategies)
  - David Bowie unexpected quote
  - "I don't know where I am going from here, but I promise it won't be boring"
* The only difference between serious improv and comedy is just letting yourself be serious
  - Don't be afraid of going serious, act with your intelligence
  - Don't be afraid of delaying the joke for a while, the buildup will make it all the better
* The improv warmup has a structure
  - Social - get to know your partners and understand how they work
  - Story - get into a basic narrative mode
  - Spontaneity - change your brain to invite unexpected results (antithesis of daily life)
  - Brain Fry - don't try to make sense, just allow yourself to be spontaneous

Class 2:
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

* More notes on games
  - Games are not going away so learn to play them
  - They can be useful even in long-form as a spice
  - Learn to play the games correctly, changing the rules changes the point of the game
  - Any rule change to the game makes it safer and thus harder to get better with
  - Treat the games a a batting practice to hone your skill
  - Feel free to fail; it doesn't matter here and is expected
  - The riskier you play the game now, the better you will be on stage
  - Feel free to play them differently on stage
* Freeze tag isn't about being clever, it is about advancing CROW as fast as possible
  - One person changes at a time, try to freeze as fast as possible, don't wait for a magic position
  - If you know how to justify one position, then take the other and make your partner look good
  - Yell freeze before you know what is going on, you can find out in the game
* To be successful as a troupe, you need to build a relationship with audience
  - Randy gave some ass-pulled stats about returning audience members
  - Being good / bad / niche will only bring someone out once
  - Making a personal connection of some form is the only way to bring them back
* When you are doing improv, use as much of your life as possible
  - Location work, names, characters, etc
  - This will add a heavy dose of realism (where do you keep your lightbulbs vs. where would you find them in a made up kitchen)
  - This also reduces the amount of things you have to spend mental energy on; you already have these things memorized
* When dealing with a shitty / drunk crowd, you can control them
  - Before the show, walk the audience and generally great them / make notes of trouble spots
  - Deal with bad suggestions by choosing who you want suggestions from
  - Choose support roles from sober people who lock eyes with you in the crowd
* Don't shy away from awkward suggestions
  - Generally it is a sign that the audience thinks you could use some help
  - Use the suggestion directly, but in a smart way and these suggestions go away
  - If they keep coming, refer to the previous note
* When using suggestions, you have two options
  - Start at the known (suggestion) and go to unknown
  - Start far away from the known and head towards it
  - Either option is fine
* Stories are simply about advancing and expanding
  - Find out which mode you operate in by how do you listen to stories at parties (details vs get to the point)
  - Improv tools for telling stories are free association and reincorporation
  - reincorporation helps the story flow back into itself strengthening the narrative
* When telling a story, you should know in the first five offers the promise
  - If you haven't gotten it yet, you are trolling for ideas: choose something
  - The promise is a yes no question that when answered will resolve the story
  - Although you may not know the answer to the question yet, you can assume it based on how you think the audience would expect it to end
  - This doesn't have to be the case, but don't work to flip it just to be creative

Class 3:
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

* The key to a good story is reincorporation
  - otherwise you are just continually adding new things instead of telling a story
  - take the things that you have created and keep folding them back into the story
* Find your character's personal wants after you have found your yes / no question
  - these wants may be the same as the yes / no question or different
  - the characters may have opposing wants (love vs hate)
  - answering the yes / no question can also solve the want
  - a good example of this is catastrophy movies (do we survive and then fall in love)
* The key to making the scene interesting is to heighten the stakes of the wants
  - make them life or death figuratively or literally
  - heighten the stakes during expanding, never during advancement of the story
  - you can gift your partner an option to heighten their character
  - however it is usually easier to just heighten your own character (use your own offer)
  - call from Ray is an example of a free heightening offer (we know we should heighten now, but how)
  - add emotion to your wants; if the audience isn't convinced they will change the channel
* Do not mirror your parter's emotions (wallpapering emotions)
  - try and have each character play different levels; this adds depth
  - exchanging emotions is a game that illustrates this
* Remember the illustration of working backwards in using offers
  - use the offers that you have been given; there is plenty to do with every offer
  - first offer best offer
  - do not spend your time fishing for more unknown offers, they may never come
  - with more than one character, each character may find different unknowns
  - if the scene gives you more, feel free to use those offers to strengthen the previous ones
  - always fold the old offers back in and never drop them; the audience thinks you are cheating
* There are different opinions of how to use the
  - Keith Johnstone: start with the offer and move towards some unknown
  - for death in 60 seconds, start dead!
  - Del Close: put the offer as far away from you as possible and try and get there
  - you may never get to the offer, but that is okay; the audience will see the attempt
  - Viola Spolina: who cares about the story, just play the game and it will come
