Functions
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

A functions takes arguments from the domain and map them to outputs in the
codomain. Functions are specified as: `f : x -> y`.

* **injective** (one to one / monomorphic) 

  functions in which every element in the codomain is mapped to by at most one
  element of the domain. `\forall x,x' \in X, f(x) = f(x') => x = x'`.

* **surjective** (onto / epimorhpic)

  functions in which every element of the codomain is mapped to by at least one
  element of the domain. `\forall y \in Y, \exists x \in X such that y = f(x)`.

* **bijective** (one to one correspondance / isomorphic)

  functions in which every element of the codomain is mapped to by exactly one
  element of the domain (both injective and surjective).
