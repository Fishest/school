~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Engine
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* cruise at 2400 RPMs or without vibration
* for long cruises, shift to neutral for 5 minutes every two hours
* for long cruises, vary the RPMs periodically
* only shift below 850 RPMs
* start engine at 1/3 forward throttle (1500 RPMs)
* put in reverse while sailing to prevent windmilling
* never switch the battery switch while the engine is on
* never start the engine while shore power is connected
* never stop the engine with the key; use the fuel cutoff switch

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Upwind
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* roll tack
* procedure:

  1.  ease helm and let boat pull upwind
  1a. power up mainsail before tack
  1b. come off rail and tack up slack on lazy sheet
  2.  power through wind to opposite tack
  2a. move traveler over as you roll tack
  2b. undo any wraps on working sheet and blow when luffed
  3.  ease off to gain speed, then point as you power up
  3a. ease off mainsheet to power up and trim up
  3b. set the jib to general setting and hit the rail / maintrim will fine tune

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Douses
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* Leeward Douse
* Windward Douse
* Mexican Douse

- set the outhaul, blow boom vang
- tack, bowsprit, halyard

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Controls
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* Main Sheet

  - controls leech tension
  - pointing ability
  - power of the sail

  Use the upper tell-tale to see how much twist is in the sail. If the top tell
  tale is stalled, ease off the main-sheet until it flows. Keep the top batten
  parallel to the boom. If the outside tell tale curls to the lee then the main
  is over trimmed. If the inside tell tale drops then the main is not trimmed
  enough. If the inside tell tales fully lift, then the main is over trimmed.

  Oversheeting the main will close the leech, increase weather helm, and point
  the bow up. Easing the sheet opens the leech and decreases weather helm and
  causes the boat to sail straighter. Slightly over trim to point better.

* Halyard

  Controls the entry angle and draft position. A tighet halyard moves the draft
  forward while a loose halyard moves the draft aft. Pull it tight until there
  is a crease in the luff that the wind will straighten out.

* Traveler

  This keeps the sail twist the same but changes the angle of entry to the wind.
  It also affects pointing ability. Use it to keep the helm neutral. Travel up
  with lower wind, travel down with gusts or as the breeze builds.

* Cunningham

  Draft forward is better in heavier wind with an open leech to depower
  (tightened). In light air, draft back with a closed leech for power (eased).

* Outhaul

  Controls shape in the lower aft portion of the mainsail. A loose outhaul
  makes the bottom of the main more full and closes the leech for more power.
  A tight outhaul flattens the bottom of the main and opens the leach to
  reduce power.

* Vang

  Used to remove twist in the mainsail, usually on downwind. Too little allows
  too much twist, flattening the mainsail up top and reducing power. Vang on
  decreases twist and makes the top of the main more deep and powerful.

* Backstay

* Foresail Cars

  Moving the cars forward will close the leech thus power up the sail.
  Moving them back will open the leech to spill power. Attempt to set
  the cars such that a line 50% of the luff to the clew points to the
  car position.

  Also try to set the same distance off the spreaders and stanchion
  base.

  Try also to locate them such that the foresail luff breaks evenly
  top-to-bottom: if the foresail first breaks high, move them forward,
  if it first breaks low, move them aft.

* Foresail Sheet

  When trimmed correctly, the wind will flow evenly over all the tell tales.
  Overtrimming creates back eddies that cause the telltales on the back of
  the foresail to stall; ease the trim out. Try to match the profile of the
  foresail and the mainsail (same camber and angle).

* Headstay Sag

  This is controlled by the backstay tension and shroud tension. More sag
  makes the luff fuller and moves the draft forward increasing power.
  Increasing the backstay tension reduces sag. Fuller shape in chop, finer
  shape in flat water.

* Symmetric Spinnaker Trim

  A full shape is more stable in chop or when pumping (leeches closer together).
  In flatter water conditions a flatter shape provides more exposed area
  (leeches father apart).

  A higher pole flattens the top of the spinnaker and depowers the leeches. It
  flattens the luff and moves the draft aft closing the leech.

  Lowering the pole stabalizes the spinnaker and makes it easier to fly. This moves
  the draft forward and opens the leeches. Try to keep the two clews equal height.

  The spinnaker pole should be square to the wind (90 degrees) and aligned with
  the mainsail boom. Oversquaring the pole means over trimming the sheet.

  Moving the sheet fairlead forward tightens the leech and powers the foot with
  increased depth (like the foresail). Moving it aft flattens the foot and opens
  the leech.

* Asymmetric Spinnaker Trim

  The tack line controls the luff tension and shape. A looser tack makes a rounder
  luff, a tighter luff means less power.

Control Settings
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* **Light Air**

  - Outhaul loose
  - Cunningham off

  - Traveler up to boom on center line
  - Mainsheet keep the top batten parallel with the boom

* **Moderate Air**

  - Outhaul maxed
