Moonlight Flit
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

What follows is a guide for the sailboat known as Moonlight Flit. Not only does
this servce as an instruction guide for all the systems, but it also servces as
a repair, maintainence, part listing, and general knowledge of the boat. If
something changes on the boat, please update the documentation so there is no
guesswork when:

* a new person on the boat needs to know how to make it work
* something needs to be serviced or repaired
* something goes wrong and one needs to root cause the issue
* a part gets dropped in the water and needs to be replaced
* understand why decisions were made with the boat when making modifications

================================================================================
Outboard Engine
================================================================================

The sailboat is run with a Mercury 2-Stroke 9.9 HP outboard. It is fixed in
place and not used to steer. Simply raise or lower it, start or stop it, and
then use the tiller to steer. There is no prop walk or wash with this outboard.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Starting Operation
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

#. Turn the (red) battery switch to (1)
#. Open and clip the engine locker open (while using the engine)
#. Put the engine in neutral gear (on the throttle)
#. Pull the engine towards you for one click and then slowly lower in the water
#. Attach the fuel hose
#. Open the gas can vent (unscrew the dime sized knob on top)
#. Pump the primer bulb twice
#. Pull the choke out all the way
#. Turn the choke all the way clockwise (fast idle)
#. Press and hold the starter (black button) for a few seconds until it starts
#. Push the choke in half way
#. Turn the choke slowly all the way counter clockwise (slow idel)
#. Push the choke in all the way
#. Lightly go in gear before returning to neutral
#. Accelerate consistently (do not jump to running at top speed)

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Stopping Operation
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

#. Pull out the fuel hose and store to the side
#. Throttle up to peak for a few seconds
#. Throttle down to just above neutral and let run till it dies
#. If you were in salt water, run a hose near the water intake to flush
#. While in forward gear, pull engine towards you for three clicks
#. Put the engine in neutral gear
#. Close the gas can vent
#. Close the engine locker

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
What Not To Do
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

* Do not switch the battery switch to (off) while the outboard is running
  This will blow out the alternator if it is wired through the battery switch.

* Do not run without opening the gas can vent
  The engine will simply choke out and stall (if it even starts). If it stalls,
  simply open the gas vent and restart.

* Do not run with the choke open
  This will choke out the carborator and eventually stall out. If it stalls,
  simply close the choke and restart the engine.

* Do not leave the outboard sitting in water
  It will cause the gear box to be overhauled sooner. The gearbox cleaning

* Do not store after running in saltwater without rinsing
  This will corrode parts and build up deposits in the engine.

* Do not use gas without 2-cycle oil added
  This will burn out the engine.

* Do not use cheap gas / oil / or gas without stablizer
  This will gum up the components and will require an overhaul sooner.

* Do not overprime the engine (pressing the fuel bulb)
  This will flood the engine which will need to dry before running. To fix this
  you can wait, or you can open the engine, take out the spark plugs, try and
  start it a few times, replace the spark plugs, and you should be good to go.

* Do not hold the starter for more than five seconds
  If you do this again and again for too long without breaks in between (say
  5 to 10 minutes), you will burn out the starter motor.

* Do not run the batteries down
  If this happens you won't be able to use the ignition switch. If you are near
  the shore, you can plug in the battery charger. If you are on the water, use
  the pull chord and then let the alternator charge the battery back up.

* Outboard Servicing
  http://ballardmarineservice.com/

  There is one Mercury Licensed service center near Seattle and that is Ballard
  Marine Services. Although they are not cheap, they know what they are doing
  and they are the only certified Mercury dealership in town. If it is a small
  issue like a servicing, find the best cost. However, if there is a problem,
  please just go to them. Be warned, if you ask their opinion on anything, they
  will push the "Mercury" brand (fittings, fuel tanks, paint, etc). The plus
  side is that you know it will work correctly and they will have it in stock.

* Mercury Engine Paint
  Model # 4531208 | Mfg # 802878Q50

  If you would like to repaint the outboard (say the prop if it is starting to
  weather), then you can get a three stage paint system from mercury. Simply
  sand / steel brush the material down to the metal and then prime / paint /
  gloss.

* Fuel can part and cost
* Fuel can adapter part and cost
* Mercury Fuel Line Kit (Attwood)
  Mfg #93806MUS7

  The reasoning to use this over a cheaper Walmart kit is that this allows low
  permeation allowing less air and water to enter the carb. Cheaper kits will
  stretch and the connections will flex which allows air into the carb which
  causes hiccups and puttering. To install, simply connect the fuel connector
  to the fuel tank you are using (push in, twist clockwise, and pull back to
  test the lock) and then attach the fuel valve to the outboard.

* Mercury Quickare Fuel Treatment (1)
  Model #12419586 | Mfg #8M0047920

  This should be added every time the fuel is refilled (both left and right
  tanks). For (6) gallons of fuel add 0.6 ounces.

* Mercury Quickleen Engine and Fuel System Cleaner (2) 
  Model #12419594 | Mfg #8M0047921

  This should be added every other time the fuel is refilled. Simply add it to
  the tank on the left and make sure to switch tanks between refills. For (6)
  gallons of fuel add 1.2 ounces.

* Mercury Quickstor Fuel Stabalizer (3) 
  Model _ | Mfg #8M0047932

  Ideally fuel will not be stored over winter and instead dropped off at the 
  hazardous waste dump in the spring. However if there is a good bit of fuel
  left that can be stored, make sure to add this to it.  For (6) gallons of fuel
  add 1.2 ounces.

* Mercury / Quicksilver Premium 2-cycle oil
  Model #542178 | Mfg #858020Q01

  Do not use cheap 2-stroke oil that you would use in a lawn mower. This gums up
  the engine, causes it to smoke, and idel hard. This should be added at a 50/1
  ratio to the fuel. This means 15.4 ounces or 0.96 pints (one bottle is fine).

* Marine Grade Non-Ethanol Unleaded (87) Minimum Octane Fuel

  The fuel filter for the outboard is pretty simple so it does not remove too
  much from the oil / fuel mixture. Futhermore, the engine does not handle
  ethanol too terribly well and will generally result in water in the fuel line.
  This causes the engine to hiccup, putter, and smoke. Furthermore, using a good
  fuel will keep the servicing costs low and far apart. Morrisons fuel dock in
  south lake union is ideal.

  When you fill up the cans, make sure they are on the ground (not on the boat)
  and fill up to 6 gallons (they hold 6.5 each). This makes sure they are not
  overfilled, gives room to expand, and allows room for the additives. Make
  sure to add the additives first so a good mixture can occur.

Water System
================================================================================

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Fresh Water System
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Under the starboard forward bench there is a 10 gallon freshwater tank. At the
moment, the only way to fill this is to run a hose into the boat and fill it.
To fill it simply shine a flashlight and watch the water level rise.

To use it, turn on the water pump from the electrical panel and then use the
second faucet which has a on / off push button switch to pump water or not.
The motor for this is located just aft of the water tank.

It should be noted that at the moment, the drain thru hull has been disabled
for reasons I am not sure (perhaps the previous owner did not understand the
healing issues or they were simply worried about the seacock). As such, the
water will drain from the sink to the port side of the hull. Furthermore, there
is not a drain from that side to the bilge so the water will sit. Before using
the water system, a bucket must be added or simply do not use the water until
the seacocks and drain hose are replaced.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Salt Water System
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

There is a single thru hull under the sink which takes salt-water from outside
the boat into the top sink faucet. This is useful for doing things like washing
dishes before finally rinsing them with the fresh water system. It functions by
using the pump arm on the faucet to draw water.

There is a second thru-hull for the sink and ice box drain. These are shared
via a y-split hose. 

When under sail, the seacocks for both of theses systems should be closed to
prevent salt water from flowing back when healed over. They can be re-opened
when back in crusing mode.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Head System
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The head system is fairly simple. There is a head which has a salt water intake
via a thru-hull under the starboard side bench. The flush system has two modes:

* dry pump out of the head (for removing waste)
* wet pump out of the head (to rinse residuals)

Generally, wet pump before you go to coat the head, then dry pump what you make
and finally wet pump as little as needed. This is because we want to fill the
holding tank as little as possible. From the pump line the waste flows into a 
y-valve that controls weither the waste goes overboard or into the holding tank
(which is actually a PVC bad to save weight). It should be noted that the
current configuration is installed incorrectly so pointing to the holding tank
actually pumps over. Keep this in mind.

When the head is not in use, make sure the pump is left on the dry mode which
will keep the tank from filling when healed over.

To clean the head system, there is a pump-out on the hull which can be opened
with a standard deck key and cleaned at the pump out station. When pumping out,
make sure to rinse with water and bleach after fully emptying the tank. This
will keep the smell down.

Every so often, run white vinegar through the head system if you are pumping out
or bleach if you are running into the tank.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Thru Hulls
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The boat has (5) thru hull points not including the drain points from the
cockpit to the transom:

#. Under the sink salt water pump intake
#. Under the sink ice-box and sink drain
#. Under the starboard bench head sink
#. Under the v-berth starboard depth sounder
#. Under the v-berth starboard knotmeter transducer

The bungs for the thru hulls are located in the port locker (sliding white tray).
The screw bung for the instrument transducers is in the same package.
