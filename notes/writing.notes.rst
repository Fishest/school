Pixar's 22 Rules of Storytelling
======================================================================

1.  You admire a character for trying more than for their successes.
2.  You gotta keep in mind what's interesting to you as an audience,
    not what's fun to do as a writer. They can be v. different.
3.  Trying for theme is important, but you won't see what the story is
    actually about til you're at the end of it. Now rewrite.
4.  Once upon a time there was ___. Every day, ___. One day ___. Because
    of that, ___. Because of that, ___. Until finally ___.
5.  Simplify. Focus. Combine characters. Hop over detours. You'll feel
    like you're losing valuable stuff but it sets you free.
6.  What is your character good at, comfortable with? Throw the polar
    opposite at them. Challenge them. How do they deal?
7.  Come up with your ending before you figure out your middle.
    Seriously. Endings are hard, get yours working up front.
8.  Finish your story, let go even if it's not perfect. In an ideal world
    you have both, but move on. Do better next time.
9.  When you're stuck, make a list of what WOULDN'T happen next. Lots of
    times the material to get you unstuck will show up.
10. Pull apart the stories you like. What you like in them is a part of
    you; you've got to recognize it before you can use it.
11. Putting it on paper lets you start fixing it. If it stays in your
    head, a perfect idea, you'll never share it with anyone.
12. Discount the 1st thing that comes to mind. And the 2nd, 3rd, 4th,
    5th - get the obvious out of the way. Surprise yourself.
13. Give your characters opinions. Passive/malleable might seem likable
    to you as you write, but it's poison to the audience.
14. Why must you tell THIS story? What's the belief burning within you
    that your story feeds off of? That's the heart of it.
15. If you were your character, in this situation, how would you feel?
    Honesty lends credibility to unbelievable situations.
16. What are the stakes? Give us reason to root for the character. What
    happens if they don't succeed? Stack the odds against.
17. No work is ever wasted. If it's not working, let go and move on -
    it'll come back around to be useful later.
18. You have to know yourself: the difference between doing your best &
    fussing. Story is testing, not refining.
19. Coincidences to get characters into trouble are great; coincidences
    to get them out of it are cheating.
20. Exercise: take the building blocks of a movie you dislike. How d'you
    rearrange them into what you DO like?
21. You gotta identify with your situation/characters, can't just write
    'cool'. What would make YOU act that way?
22. What's the essence of your story? Most economical telling of it? If
    you know that, you can build out from there.

Kurt Vonnegut's 8 Rules of Creative Writing
======================================================================

1. Use the time of a total stranger in such a way that he or she will
   not feel the time was wasted.
2. Give the reader at least one character he or she can root for.
3. Every character should want something, even if it is only a glass
   of water.
4. Every sentence must do one of two things—reveal character or advance
   the action.
5. Start as close to the end as possible.
6. Be a sadist. No matter how sweet and innocent your leading characters,
   make awful things happen to them—in order that the reader may see what
   they are made of.
7. Write to please just one person. If you open a window and make love
   to the world, so to speak, your story will get pneumonia.
8. Give your readers as much information as possible as soon as possible.
   To heck with suspense. Readers should have such complete understanding
   of what is going on, where and why, that they could finish the story
   themselves, should cockroaches eat the last few pages.
